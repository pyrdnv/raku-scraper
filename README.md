### Quick Start

Hereâ€™s a quick example that demonstrates the simplicity and power of `RakuScraper`. In this example, we will automate the process of accepting cookies on a webpage, then scrape the title of the webpage before and after changing the language of the webpage.

```python
# Import the necessary classes from RakuScraper
from raku_scraper import ScrapingTask, RakuScraper  

# Create a scraping task for a specific URL
task = ScrapingTask(url="https://www.example.com", title="Example Page", description="A test page")

# Add steps to the scraping task
task.add_action(step_id="accept_cookies", selector="#cookie_accept", action="click", description="Accept cookies")
task.add_selector(step_id="page_title", selector="h1.title", attribute="text", description="Get the title of the page")
task.add_action(step_id="change_language", selector="#language_toggle", action="click", description="Change language")
task.add_selector(step_id="page_title_after_language_change", selector="h1.title", attribute="text", description="Get the title of the page after language change")

# Create a RakuScraper instance and execute the scraping task
scraper = RakuScraper(task, headless=False)  # Set headless to True for headless mode
results = scraper.scrape()

# Print the scraped data
print("Results:", results)
```
